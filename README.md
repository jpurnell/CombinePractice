# CombinePractice
Little more than a playground for duffing around with Combine and SwiftUI. Code inspired by Daniel Steinberg's [A Combine Quickstart](https://gumroad.com/l/combineKickstart)
This is mostly for archiving working states in case I need to roll back, but exploring using publishers and publisher pipelines for multiple streams, general transformations/calculations, and some very, very light animation/charting
